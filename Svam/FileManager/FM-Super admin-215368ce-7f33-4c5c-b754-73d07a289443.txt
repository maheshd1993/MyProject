Dear Sir

Still following issues are pending while working on CRM: 

Not able to upload a file which is more than 3-4 MB

If we close/ or portal get closed without logout then we are not able to login again

Highlighted option for Status of work are not responding. - Still Pending

Can't assign Form to any employee - Still Not able to assign it, no pop up of form assigned 

In Member login Pending task list should be relevant to his profile. Currently it shows all pending task in each member's login. -  Task list of all members are blank no task shown even after assignment 
Weekly Task & Daily task list shows all task instead of task of selected period. - Task list is blank now 
    
How can we create State & District for updation of complete Address

After uploading thrice it show no record found for Bird Automotive Pvt Ltd.
